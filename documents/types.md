# Types of RAML Documents

RAML documents can introduce information in two different ways depending on how the URI identifying the information is generated:

- Information can be **encoded**:  In this case the URL of the document is the URI identifying the graph of information in the document that can be linked from other RAML documents
- Information can be **declared**: In this case, a particular URI for each declared entity in the graph, different from the URL of the document  will be generated by AMF and it can be used from other RAML documents to link to those entities.
