Application Modeling Framework (AMF) is a set of tools to describe and connect information into a unified knowledge graph in a simple way.\nAMF works at three different levels:\n\nDescribes the meaning of the information as a set of shared vocabularies\nPublishes data as a decentralized web of modular linked documents making use of the defined vocabulary terms and following well defined schemas\nIntegrates the linked documents as a single data graph that can be browsed and queried by AMF clients\n\nThe preferred syntax to describe information and data in AMF is based on the YAML syntax used in MuleSoft's RAML 1.0 API specification language. RAML is an extension to YAML that allows documents to link to other RAML document fragments and build reusable collections of data as RAML libraries. RAML 1.0 and RAML 0.8 documents are valid documents supported by AMF.\nOther types of documents, like OpenAPI documents, or GraphQL schemas can be integrated in AMF through plugins. OpenAPI 2.0 is already supported by AMF 1.0.\nHTTP and hyperlinks are the chosen mechanisms to publish and link data in AMF. Information published using AMF is RESTful (including hypermedia) by design and it can be manipulated through the uniform HTTP interface.\nAMF uses W3C recommendations like JSON-LD and SHACL to integrate, validate and make it easy for machines to process the information described in human friendly RAML documents.\n"},"documents/intro.html":{"url":"documents/intro.html","title":"Modular Linked Documents","keywords":"","body":"Modular Linked Documents\nIn order to publish a graph of information in a decentralized way, we need a common way of encoding the information, a mechanism to expose it, so it can be accessed and manipulated by information consumers and a way to identify and connect subsets of information published by different authors.\nHTML documents, URLs and HTTP are the solutions used in the web to solve this problem. AMF re-uses URLs and HTTP to publish and identify information but uses RAML as the preferred document format for the information published using AMF.\nRAML is a simple YAML based syntax introduced by MuleSoft to describe HTTP APIs in a human friendly. The main characteristics of RAML are:\n\nIt is an extension to YAML, every valid RAML document is valid YAML 1.2 document\nRAML documents are linked documents. It supports hypermedia through the !includetag.\nRAML documents are modular. They can be reused in other documents through the declaration of RAML libraries and RAML fragments.\n\nAMF can parse a RAML document and generate a graph of information encoded in JSON-LD potentially including links to other RAML documents. Each RAML document is a subgraph of a bigger decentralized graph formed by the set of linked RAML documents.\nEach RAML document exposed through HTTP is RESTful resource that can be manipulated through the HTTP uniform interface providing in this way an interface for AMF clients to mutate the decentralized information graph.\nRAML documents in AMF can also be validated and can describe the meaning of the data in the document using a set of shared terms defined in a RAML vocabulary reused in many different RAML documents.\nInformation in other formats than RAML, like OpenAPI, can be integrated in the graph exposing it through HTTP and implementing a plugin for the AMF parser that is capable of mapping that document format into a JSON-LD graph.\nIn the next sections of this chapter we will review the syntax and types of RAML documents and how they can be combined to provide a modular description of information.\n"},"documents/syntax.html":{"url":"documents/syntax.html","title":"RAML Syntax","keywords":"","body":"RAML Syntax\nRAML syntax is just an extension to YAML in order to support links between documents and introduce modularity in the description of information.\nRAML dialect declaration\nEach RAML document must start with a comment declaring which particular graph of data is encoded in the document in order for the AMF parser to validate and extract the graph of data encoded in the document.\nThis information is called the RAML dialect and includes the name and the version of the dialect used in the document. New dialects encoding different data graphs can be defined using AMF.\nThe following example introduces a RAML 1.0 document:\n#%RAML 1.0\n\nThe following declaration introduces the document as a customer custom validation document using the custom validation profile dialect:\n#%Validation Profile 1.0\n\nDocuments without declaration and not supported by any AMF plugin will be parsed as an external fragment containing the raw textual content of the document.\nLinking full documents with !include\nFull RAML documents containing a graph of information that can be reused in different documents, known as RAML Fragments, can be linked from other RAML documents using the !include tag.

RAML 1.0 and OpenAPI 2.0 specifications for example, describe information about Web APIs. This process of capturing knowledge usually referred to as information modeling and is independent of how this knowledge is going to be used to provide the semantics for the graph of information published as a set of linked RAML documents.\nRAML Vocabularies can be used to create a taxonomy of concepts used in an organization and can work with standard vocabularies like Schema.org.\nOn the other hand a RAML Dialect arranges the terms in a vocabulary describing the valid syntax of a new type of RAML document. In this way it is also prescribing the shape of the data graph that will be parsed by AMF. RAML Dialects also define which modular RAML units are valid for the dialect: which information can be encoded in RAML Fragments or declared as reusable RAML Libraries.\nRAML Dialects can also be used to validate new RAML documents for the dialect or in the view of RAML documents as HTTP resources, to validate the creation of new resources in the graph.\nTerms from one RAML Vocabulary can be used in multiple RAML Dialects and one RAML Dialect can use and mix any number of RAML Vocabularies.

Property term ranges can be a class term, if the property defines a relationship between types of entities or a scalar type if the property term is just a data property for entities.\nThe following example is a subset of the RAML Vocabulary used by AMF describing the types of RAML documents introduced in the previous chapter of this book:\n#%RAML 1.0 Vocabulary\n\nbase: \"http://raml.org/vocabularies/document#\"\n\nusage: |\n  Document Model vocabulary for AMF.

By formal we mean that it has a precise semantics described using a mathematical foundation. We are using a very small subset of the official W3C Recommendation OWL2 to provide the logical foundation for RAML Vocabularies.\nOne important notion in the design of a RAML Vocabulary is that, following OWL2 semantics, they follow the open-world assumption. A RAML Vocabulary is not a schema that can be used to validate the integrity of data (RAML Dialects can be used for that) but assumes that the information is going to be incomplete and can be used to infer new knowledge algorithmically (for instance using a compliant OWL2 reasoner).\nLinking vocabularies\nRAML Vocabulary documents can refer to terms described in other documents using them as RAML Libraries containing declarations of terms.\nAdditionally, external vocabularies like Schema.org can be used inside a RAML vocabulary using the external keyword. The only condition is to associate a URI prefix to the vocabulary to generate the URIs identifying the entities in that vocabulary.\nParsing vocabularies\nAMF can parse RAML Vocabularies and generate an output data graph as with any other RAML document.\nEvery term in the vocabulary will be parsed generating a unique URI for it.

We want to avoid ambiguity about what is valid and invalid for a particular model. All the constraints defined have explicit identifiers and clients can access the full list of validations and their definitions.\n\nThe validation mechanism is formal\n\nAMF uses a W3C recommendation SHACL, to implement validation. SHACL provide powerful and clearly defined closed world semantics to validate information models, beyond what can be achieved through more limited validation schema languages like JSON-Schema. Thanks to SHACL sound logical foundation, we can explain easily why a model is invalid.\n\nValidations can be customised\n\nAMF introduces the notion of a validation profile. Profiles group validations into sets of related constraints following certain semantics or standard requirements. RAML 1.0, OAS 2.0 are valid profiles that will ensure compatibility between the parsed model and these specifications. Furthermore, clients can create a custom validation profile, selecting the validations that are important for their use case, setting the right severity level for each validation or modifying one of the standard profiles, turning on and off individual validations in that profile.\n\nValidations can be extended\n\nAMF validation profiles can be extended with custom validations defined by clients. A declarative approach using AMF validation profile dialect can be used to define new validations or a programmatic mechanism based on JavaScript functions can be followed. Advanced users can always define standard SHACL constraints to have complete control over the validation mechanism.\n\nValidations are data\n\nAMF can parse the validation profile for an API and generate a model in the same way it parses the API definition itself. API model and validation profile model can be linked, stored, and queried as a single unified data graph.\nValidation using data shapes\nThe main notion in AMF validation is that of a data shape.\nThe output of the AMF parser is a data graph where the nodes in the graph and their relationships capture the information of the input RAML or OAS document.\nData shapes impose restrictions about the valid properties and relationships for the nodes in the parsed data graph, grouped by node type.\nFor example, the following extract from a RAML document located at http://exchange.mulesoft.com/myorg/loans.raml:\ntitle: Loans API\nversion: 0.3\n\nWill produce the following data graph:\n\nAs we can see in the image, the 'title' RAML property has been parsed and mapped to the schema-org 'name' property in the parsed model and the 'version' property has been mapped to the schema-org 'version' property. At the same time, the main API document located at the root of the document #/ has been marked as being an instance of schema-org WebAPI class.\nIn order to consider the model encoded in this graph as valid, we might want to impose some restrictions for the nodes in the graph of type schema:WebAPI, for example, if certain properties are mandatory or optional, the range of the data type for the properties, etc.\nIn order to do this, we can define a 'data shape' constraining all instances of the schema:WebAPI type. For example, we can make the version mandatory and impose a pattern for the version string. This can be achieved using AMF validation profile syntax in the following way:\nvalidations:\n\n  version-constraints:\n    message: Version is mandatory and must be a semantic version M.m.r?\n    targetClass: schema.WebAPI\n    propertyConstraints:\n      schema.version:\n        minCount: 1\n        pattern: \"\\d+\\.\\d+(\\.\\d+)?\"\nThis snippet of text declares a new data shape (identified by 'version-constraints') for all instances of the schema:WebAPI class where for the schema.version property the minimum count of the property must be 1 (making it mandatory) and the value of the property must match the provided regular expression.\nAMF validation will parse this data shape definition and validate that the model complies with all the data shapes defined. If some constraints are not met, a validation report including the node in the graph that violates the constraint, the identifier of the violated constraint and property, a descriptive message and information about the location in the input document of the model information violating the constraint will be generated.\nValidation Profiles\nIn order to use data shapes in any realistic way, a number of data shapes must be defined and re-used together many times to provide a consistency in different RAML documents. We call these sets of related validations 'validation profiles'. AMF allows customers to define validation profiles using a declarative validation syntax.\nAdditionally, profiles also support the notion of a severity level for each validation, ranging from VIOLATION to INFO, that can be attached to each specific data shape in the profile.\nProfiles can extend other profiles, adding or re-defining validations, changing the severity level or disabling some of the base profile validations.\nAMF includes by default 3 validation profiles: RAML, OpenAPI and AMF that follow respectively the constraints defined in the RAML 1.0 specification, OpenAPI 2.0 specification and the common set of validations across both specifications.\nFor example, the OpenAPI profile defines a validation to make the 'schema:version' property mandatory (identified by amf-parser.mandatory-api-version), but the RAML profile doesn't include this validation since it is not mandatory in RAML.\nAMF clients can decide if they want to use the OpenAPI or RAML standard profile, create a custom profile inheriting from each of these but adapting some of the data shapes to their own needs or to create a new validation profile completely from scratch.\nValidation architecture\nThis section describes the technical details of the AMF validation mechanism. If you are just interested into using the validation mechanism and you are not interested into advanced use cases like using SHACL directly, this section can be safely skipped.\nThe following diagram shows the main components of the validation mechanism in AMF:\n\nValidation involves two model graphs:\n\ndata graph\n\nGenerated after parsing the input RAML/OAS document, containing all the information in the domain model, like the HTTP API\n\nshapes graph\n\nGenerated after parsing a custom or standard validation profile and containing restrictions about the shape of the domain entities in the data graph. Shapes are expressed as SHACL shapes.\nThe following diagram shows the standard data shapes that can be expressed in SHACL:\n\nAdditional shapes can be added to SHACL to define new types of validations. Additionally SHACL also supports JavaScript constraints that can be defined inline as JavaScript code or collected into validation libraries.\nBoth graphs, the data graph and the shapes graph, can be serialised using AMF as JSON-LD documents containing all the information about the graph.\nIn order to trigger the validation, both graphs are passed to the standard SHACL 1.0 library that will compute the potential violations according to SHACL semantics and generate a validation report as an output data graph.\nThis report can be serialised as a JSON-LD document that can be processed by machines or as a human-friendly textual report.\nValidation Profile syntax\nValidation profile documents are defined as a RAML Dialect extension (see the documentation about RAML Vocabulary and Dialect to know how to work with RAML extensions).\nHeader and dialect document type\nThe header identifying the Validation Profile dialect and the current 1.0 version is:\n#%Validation Profile 1.0\n\nThis header is mandatory in all validation profile documents.\nProfile node\nThe main node in a Validation Profile document is the Profile node.\nThese are the possible properties in the node:\n\n\n\nproperty\ndescription\nrange\nallow multiple values\nis map\n\n\n\n\nprofile\nName for the custom profile\nstring\nfalse\nfalse\n\n\nprefixes\nMap of prefixes used to build identifiers in validation of dialects\n(String,String)\ntrue\ntrue\n\n\ndescription?\nHuman readable description of the profile\nstring\nfalse\nfalse\n\n\nextends?\nBase profile this profile is extending\nstring: RAML, OpenAPI, AMF\nfalse\nfalse\n\n\nviolation?\nList of validations identifiers that will have VIOLATION severity\nstring\ntrue\ntrue\n\n\nwarning?\nList of validations identifiers that will have WARNING severity\nstring\ntrue\nfalse\n\n\ninfo?\nList of validations identifiers that will have INFO severity\nstring\ntrue\nfalse\n\n\ndisabled?\nList of validations from the extended profile that will be disabled\nstring\ntrue\nfalse\n\n\nvalidations?\nList of custom data shapes defining validations in this profile\nShapeValidation node or FunctionValidation node\n-\ntrue\n\n\n\nIn order to change the severity level or disable a validation, the identifier of the validation must be added to the right section of the document.\nRefer to the list of standard validations defined for each profile to find which validations can be modified.\nThe following example defines a new profile named Custom extending the RAML standard profile and disabling the amf-parser.raml-status-code validation including in that profile.\n#%Validation Profile 1.0\n\nprofile: Custom\n\nextends: RAML\n\ndisabled:\n  - amf-parser.raml-status-code\n\nAlso note that declaring a validation to the map of validations does not automatically enable it. Custom validation must still be added to the section with the right severity level for them to be effective.\nReview the Validation Profile documents for the standard profiles to review the list of standard validations and their definitions:\n\nAMF\nRAML\nOpenAPI\n\nIdentifying classes and properties\nAMF Validation support identifiers for the standard domain elements generated by the AMF parser for RAML and OpenAPI.\nIf you want to other classes and properties, for example when working with dialects, the URI of the element or register a prefix to use CURIEs:\n#%Validation Profile 1.0\n\nprofile: Custom Profile for My Vocabulary\n\nprefixes:\n  myvocab: http://myorg.com/vocabularies/myvocab#\n\nNow we could identify target classes and properties using CURIEs like myvocab.MyClass or myvocab.MyProperty.\nShapeValidation node\nCustom data shapes can be defined declaratively as ShapeValidation nodes that can be added to the validations property in the profile document.\nThese are the properties of a shape validation:\n\n\n\nproperty\ndescription\nrange\nalllow multiple values\nis map\n\n\n\n\nmessage?\nError message that will be returned in case of a violation\nstring\nfalse\nfalse\n\n\ntargetClass\nIdentifier of the class in the AMF parsed model the data shape will be validating. It must be a valid class identifier in the model\nstring\nfalse\nfalse\n\n\npropertyConstraints\nmap of property constraints for the data shape\nPropertyConstriaint node\n-\ntrue\n\n\n\nCheck the list of target class identifiers to find classes in the AMF model that can be the target of the data shape in the appendix at the end of this document.\nEach data shape can contain one or more constraints over properties for the class defined in a property constraint node.\nThe following example introduces a shape validation redefining the valid values for the status code of a response:\n#%Validation Profile 1.0\n\nprofile: Custom\n\nextends: RAML\n\ndisabled:\n  - amf-parser.raml-status-code\n\nviolation:\n  - my-status-code\n\nvalidations:\n\n  my-status-code:\n    message: Invalid status code value\n    targetClass: http.statusCode\n    propertyConstraint: hydra.statusCode\n    hydra.statusCode:\n      pattern: ^(ok|failure|exception)$\n\nAfter adding this constrint and disabling the standard RAML status code validation, the following fragment from RAML document will be valid:\n/endpoint:\n  get:\n    responses:\n      ok:\n      failure:\n      exception:\n\nPropertyConstraint node\nEach property constraint node is built as a map with keys targeting properties in the AMF parsed model and the constraints for that property in the model.\nThe following table defines the constraints that can be used to define the shape of the property in the model:\n\n\n\nproperty\ndescription\nrange\nalllow multiple values\nis map\n\n\n\n\npattern?\nRegular expression\nstring\nfalse\nfalse\n\n\nminLength?\nMinimum length of a string\ninteger\nfalse\nfalse\n\n\nmaxLength?\nMaximum length of a string\ninteger\nfalse\nfalse\n\n\nmaxCount?\nMaximum cardinality for the parsed property\ninteger\nfalse\nfalse\n\n\nminCount?\nMinimum cardinality for the parsed property\ninteger\nfalse\nfalse\n\n\nminExclusive?\nMinimum exclusive value for the parsed property\nnumber\nfalse\nfalse\n\n\nmaxExclusive?\nMaximum exclusive value for the parsed property\nnumber\nfalse\nfalse\n\n\nminInclusive?\nMinimum inclusive value for the parsed property\nnumber\nfalse\nfalse\n\n\nmaxInclusive?\nMaximum inclusive value for the parsed property\nnumber\nfalse\nfalse\n\n\nin?\nEnumeration of values allowed for the property\nany\ntrue\nfalse\n\n\nrange?\nLiteral range of a property from string, integer, float, anyUri, boolean\nfalse\nfalse\n\n\n\nA single property constraint can have more than one constraint in the map of constraints.\nFunctionValidation node\nAlternatively, validations can be defined programmatically using JavaScript functions.\nFunctionConstraint nodes are added to the validations property by the name of the function constraint and can have the following properties:\n\n\n\nproperty\ndescription\nrange\nalllow multiple values\nis map\n\n\n\n\nmessage?\nError message that will be returned in case of a violation\nstring\nfalse\nfalse\n\n\ntargetClass\nIdentifier of the class in the AMF parsed model the data shape will be validating. It must be a valid class identifier in the model\nstring\nfalse\nfalse\n\n\ncode?\nJavaScript function that will be invoked to check if a violation has happened for the instance of the target class passed as an argument\nstring\nfalse\nfalse\n\n\nlibraries?\nURLs pointing to JavaScript files including function definitions that will can be used in the validation\nstring\ntrue\nfalse\n\n\nfunctionName?\nName of a function in one of the libraries that will be used to check if a violation has happend for the instance of the target class passed as an argument\nstring\nfalse\nfalse\n\n\n\nValidation functions must be coded as anonymous functions accepting as single input the node in the model encoded as JSON-LD in expanded form  that is an instance of targetClass.\nValidation functions must return true if no constraint violation is found or false to signal a validation error.\nJS Validation API\nAMF validation provides a minimal interface to help build the validation functions:\nIn order to traverse the model, prefixes for all the namespaces in the model have been defined:\n{\n  \"raml-shapes\":\"http://raml.org/vocabularies/shapes#\",\n  \"shacl\":      \"http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#\",\n  \"amf-parser\": \"http://raml.org/vocabularies/amf/parser#\",\n  \"rdfs\":       \"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\",\n  \"doc\":        \"http://raml.org/vocabularies/document#\",\n  \"data\":       \"http://raml.org/vocabularies/data#\",\n  \"owl\":        \"http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\",\n  \"meta\":       \"http://raml.org/vocabularies/meta#\",\n  \"sourcemaps\": \"http://raml.org/vocabularies/document-source-maps#\",\n  \"rdf\":        \"http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\",\n  \"xsd\":        \"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\",\n  \"schema\":     \"http://schema.org/\",\n  \"http\":       \"http://raml.org/vocabularies/http#\",\n  \"sh\":         \"http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#\",\n  \"hydra\":      \"http://www.w3.org/ns/hydra/core#\"\n}\n\nThis means that validation code can use CURIEs to traverse the model JSON-LD structure instead of full URIs\nFor example the following validation targets the requests in the endpoints. In the validation function to get to the headers, we can just use http:header instead of the full URI http://raml.org/vocabularies/http#header:\nNotice that since we are working with the JSON-LD graph in expanded form, the value of a property will always be an array, even if the property has a single value.\nvalidations:\n\n  test-validation:\n    message: All requests should have headers\n    targetClass: http.Request\n    functionConstraint:\n      code: |\n        function(request) {\n          var headers = request[http:header];\n          return headers.length > 0;\n        }\n\nSometimes we need to traverse the model from the root node using a chain of properties. the path function can be used for this. It accepts a sequence of properties and will try to follow the path returning all the accumulated values found for the path.\nPaths are expressed as sequences of CURIEs joined by the / separator.\nFor example, imagine we need to modify the previous validation to check that a particular header with a name is present in all the requests. In order to do this, we need to traverse from the http:Request to the header (http:header) and from there to the name of each header (schema:header) and check that the name of the property is present. Instead of nesting loops, we could use the path property for this:\nvalidations:\n\n  test-validation:\n    message: Header x-token is mandatory in all requests\n    targetClass: http.Request\n    functionConstraint:\n      code: |\n        function(request) {\n          var pathChain = 'http:header / schema:name';\n          var headerNames = path(request, pathChain);\n          for (var i=0; i\nValidation functions should be stateless, since each validation function is executed independently. However, for certain checks we need to keep state through invocations. In order to accomplish this the validation engine offers a global accumulators hash persistent between validation function invocations. Validation functions can use this hash to keep state in order to compute certain restrictrions.\nFor example, let's imagine we need to create a validation checking that the name of the endpoints (resources in RAML, path items in OpenAPI) are unique. For that we can use the accumulators hash to store the names of the endpoints and find duplicated values:\nvalidations:\n\n  unique-identifiers:\n    message: Resource names must be unique\n    targetClass: http.EndPoint\n    functionConstraint:\n      code: |\n        function(resource) {\n          var name = (resource['schema:name'] || [])[0];\n          if(accumulators[name] == null) {\n            accumulators[name] = true;\n            return true;\n          } else {\n            return false;\n          }\n        }\n\nModular Validation Profiles: Libraries\nValidation profiles are RAML documents, as such the Validation Profile dialect defines how to split the description into a profile in libraries of data shapes that can be re-used in multiple profiles.\nTo declare a validation data shapes library, the following header must be used:\n#%RAML Library / Validation Profile 1.0\n\nIn the library validations can be declared using the shapes for the ShapeValidation nodes and functions for the FunctionValidation nodes.\nAfter being declared, validation libraries can be used in a validation profile document using the uses RAML property and providing an alias for the library\nNotice that a name for the data shape or function constraint connected to the validations property  will still be required to be able to use the data shape.\nModular Validation Profiles: Typed fragments\nIn the shame way, data shapes and function constraints can be defined as valid fragments for the Validation Profile dialect and included in a Validation Profile document.\nThe required headers for the fragments are the following:\n\n\n\nFragment header\nNode type\n\n\n\n\n#%RAML ShapeValidation / Validation Profile 1.0\nShapeValidation node\n\n\n#%RAML FunctionValidation / Validation Profile 1.0\nFunctionValidation node\n\n\n\nUsing AMF validation from the command line\nThe following section will describe how to use the validation functionality of AMF through the command line, using the AMF executable (java or node versions).\nNotice that in all invocations for local file URLs we follow the convention of omitting the hostname, and using file:/// for absolute paths and file:// for relative paths to the working directory.\nDefault profile validation\nTo validate an API you can use the validate command passing the following arguments:\n\nin: format of the document to parse (RAML, OpenAPI or AMF)\np: default profile to use (RAML, OpenAPI or AMF)\n\nFor example for this very simple API:\n#%RAML 1.0\n\ntitle: hello api\n\n/hello:\n  get:\n    responses:\n      200:\n        body:\n          text/plain:\n            type: string\n\nWe could validate it using the RAML standard profile using the following invocation:\n$ java -jar amf.jar validate -in RAML file://api.raml\n\nThe output of the invocation will the the JSON-LD document with the serialised graph for the validation report. For example if the validation is successful:\n{\n  \"@type\": \"http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#ValidationReport\",\n  \"http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#conforms\": true\n}\n\nThe exit code of the command can be used to check if the invocation was successful:\n$ java -jar amf.jar validate -in RAML file://api.raml\n{\n  \"@type\": \"http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#ValidationReport\",\n  \"http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#conforms\": true\n}\n$ echo $?\n0\n\nIf the validation fails, the validation report will include nodes with the information about the failed data shapes and the invocation will return an error code.\nFor example if we try to validate the same API using the default OpenAPI profile, we will get validation errors about the missing mandatory version:\n$ java -jar amf.jar validate -in OpenAPI file://api.raml\n{\n  \"@type\": \"http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#ValidationReport\",\n  \"http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#conforms\": false,\n  \"http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#result\": [\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#ValidationResult\",\n      \"http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#resultSeverity\": {\n        \"@id\": \"http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#Violation\"\n      },\n      \"http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#focusNode\": {\n        \"@id\": \"file://api.raml#/web-api\"\n      },\n      \"http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#resultPath\": {\n        \"@id\": \"http://schema.org/version\"\n      },\n      \"http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#resultMessage\": \"API Version is Mandatory\",\n      \"http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#sourceShape\": {\n        \"@id\": \"http://raml.org/vocabularies/amf/parser#mandatory-api-version\"\n      },\n      \"http://raml.org/vocabularies/amf/parser#lexicalPosition\": {\n        \"@type\": \"http://raml.org/vocabularies/amf/parser#Position\",\n        \"http://raml.org/vocabularies/amf/parser#start\": {\n          \"@type\": \"http://raml.org/vocabularies/amf/parser#Location\",\n          \"http://raml.org/vocabularies/amf/parser#line\": 3,\n          \"http://raml.org/vocabularies/amf/parser#column\": 0\n        },\n        \"http://raml.org/vocabularies/amf/parser#end\": {\n          \"@type\": \"http://raml.org/vocabularies/amf/parser#Location\",\n          \"http://raml.org/vocabularies/amf/parser#line\": 12,\n          \"http://raml.org/vocabularies/amf/parser#column\": 0\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n$ echo $?\n254\n\nCustom profile validation\nIn order to validate a custom profile, the URL of the validation profile document must be passed to the AMF executable.\nFor example, let's create a simple validation profile, extending the OpenAPI profile but transforming the data shape that makes the version mandatory (amf-parser:mandatory-api-version) into a simple warning:\n#%Validation Profile 1.0\n\ndescription: example validation profile\n\nprofile: Test\n\nextends: OpenAPI\n\nwarning: amf-parser.mandatory-api-version\n\nWe can invoke now the validate command passing the custom profile URL using the cp argument.

(RamlParser, OasParser and AmfParser).\nThe following Java snippet shows how to invoke programmatically the validation over the examples defined previously to be tested from the command line:\npackage mulesfot.amf;\n\nimport amf.client.RamlParser;\nimport amf.core.validation.AMFValidationReport;\n\nimport java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException;\n\nimport static java.lang.System.out;\n\npublic
